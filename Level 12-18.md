## Level 12-13
#### First, copy the file to a /tmp directory, to make it workable.
#### Reverse a hex dump - xxd -r. file command will tell about the data in the file. DIfferent types of compresson are encountered.
#### For gzip files, extension must be chnaged to gz. Use gunzip command.
#### For bnzip2, extension must be bz2. Use bunzip2 command.
#### For tar,extension isn't compulsory, however it should be tar. Use tar -xvf command
#### At every conversion, run file command to see the content type.
#### Final password is in ASCII Text file data8.bin
### Password - 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL



## Level 13-14
#### Use File command and it's discovered that the sshkey file is the key to next level
> bandit13@bandit:~$ file sshkey.private 
> sshkey.private: PEM RSA private key
> bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
#### The password for level 14 is in the directories of level 14 itself
#### Password - 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e

## Level 14 -15
#### Send files to a specific port of a server using nc command
>bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000

## Level 15-16
#### ssl encryption is anpther way of securing connection with a server
>bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
CONNECTED(00000003)

## Level 16-17
#### Use nmap as a port scanner to find ports in the given range. Only 5 ports were found active
#### Use openssl to connect to all different ports with the previous passwords
>bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
CONNECTED(00000003)
>cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
Correct!
#### This provides the RSA private key for next level

## Level 17-18
#### Save the Key to file on your system as extension `.private`. Change the permissions. Log in again using this to next server
#### we can directly apply `diff` command
>bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
passwords.new  passwords.old
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old

## Level 18-19
#### Actually difficult one.
#### You have to skip the bashrc file. You have to get the access before it executes. Instead run `/bin/bash`
